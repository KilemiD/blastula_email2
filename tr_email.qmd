## Monthly Reports

Find attached your performance report for the month ending June 30th 2023.

## Performance

The first plot is your performance on your client time dealings

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris,aes(x=Sepal.Length,y=Sepal.Width))+
  geom_point()
```

## Conclusion

We need to reduce the time we use with our clients, as that reduces the chances of your facility being found with fraud.
